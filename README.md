# Markovketten Visualisation

The aim of this project is to visualise Markov Chains and their transitions. For visualisation [d3JS](http://d3js.org/) is used. 

## Goals
Additionally advanced topics of Markov Chains will be visualised as
* stationary distribution
* communication classes
* periodicity
